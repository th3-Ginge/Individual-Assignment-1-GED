# Individual-Assignment-1-GED

My role in my GDW group is as an artist i will be contribute many of the models, textures and assets, as well i will be designing the level 

In week one we focused on setting up variables and the scences. By using input actions we created an easier way to set key bindings that would allow for better custimization and ease of use. Animations were implemented using the built in unity animator to allow our charecter to switch between the multiple animations that it had. Work was begun on implementing coins and a score mechanic.

In week two we learned how to implement score and coins. We also worked on getting bullets to fire and to  have enemies fire back,which unfortonatly i was unable to implement.  In week two the scene became more fleshed out to resemble a actual game level. How to implement respawning in the game was also taught. i was able to get my movment fleshed out although i ran into an issue with some of the colliders where the camera would heavily shake which i was unable to determine the cause of. As well as my bullets did not kill enemys instead just collide with them and push them over.
